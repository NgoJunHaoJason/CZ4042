    "This assignment uses the data from the Graduate Admissions Predication \\[2\\]. The dataset contains several parameters like GRE score (out of 340), TOEFL score (out of 120), university Rating (out of 5), strengths of Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation (out of 5), undergraduate GPA (out of 10), research experience (either 0 or 1), that are considered important during the application for Master Programs. The predicted parameter is the chance of getting an admit (ranging from 0 to 1). You can obtain the data from: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions or from file ‘admission_predict.csv’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data sample is a row of 9 values: 1 serial number (ignore), 7 input attributes and the probability of getting an admit as targets. Divide the dataset at 70:30 ratio for training and testing.\n",
